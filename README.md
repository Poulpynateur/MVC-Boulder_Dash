Copy of the Boulder dash game, made with Java (Swing and AWT).

## Problems to fix in a distant future

* Update function in elements class is redundant.
* ConcurrentModificationException on update call.

The problem is the same than describe [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48508420/reduce-code-duplication-without-subclass-inheritance).
The base organisation is messed up.
